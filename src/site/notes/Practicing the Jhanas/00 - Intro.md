This retreat, led by Rob Burbea, guides participants through a comprehensive exploration of Jhana meditation, emphasizing experiential understanding and integration into daily life. The retreat begins with foundational practices like breath awareness and energy body work, gradually introducing the factors and stages of Jhana, starting with the First Jhana and progressing through the Form and Formless Jhanas. Piti and Sukha (rapture and happiness) are central to early Jhana development, with Metta practice offered as a supportive method. Crucially, the retreat addresses working with hindrances not as obstacles but as valuable learning opportunities. Throughout the series, Rob emphasizes the art of Jhana practice, stressing sensitivity, responsiveness, and malleability of mind over forceful concentration. He highlights that Jhanas are dependent on happiness and cultivated through right view, effort, and intention, not just technique. The retreat also explores the integration of Jhanas with insight practices, and the profound impact of Jhana practice on understanding emptiness and dependent arising. Ultimately, the retreat encourages a lifelong exploration of Jhanas, emphasizing mastery, marination, and applying Jhanic qualities to enrich daily life and deepen spiritual understanding. Q&A sessions throughout address practical challenges and conceptual questions, providing personalized guidance within the retreat context.
