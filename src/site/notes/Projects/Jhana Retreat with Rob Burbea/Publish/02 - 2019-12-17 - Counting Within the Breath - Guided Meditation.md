### Details
#### Counting Within Breath Meditation
This session introduces a guided meditation technique called "counting within the breath," where one counts from one to nine during inhalation and nine to one during exhalation. This method is presented as a way to deepen focus and energize the mind, offering an alternative to traditional breath counting methods. The practice involves adjusting breath length to fit the count and aims to enhance attention and presence.
#### Meditation Posture and Poise
The importance of meditation posture is discussed, emphasizing uprightness, comfort, relaxation, and openness. The posture should reflect a balance between alertness and relaxation, embodying a sense of poise that supports the state of attention and consciousness. Finding a posture that expresses this balance is crucial for effective meditation.
#### Whole Body Awareness
Throughout the meditation, maintaining and continually opening up to whole-body awareness is emphasized. Participants are instructed to sense the connection with the support beneath them and expand their awareness to encompass the entire space of the body, even beyond the physical form. This whole-body awareness is a key element to be sustained throughout the practice.
#### Long Breath and Counting
The meditation utilizes a long, slow, smooth, and comfortable breath as the foundation for counting. Participants are guided to find their longest comfortable breath and estimate the pace of counting from one to nine within that breath. This long breath is intended to energize the energy system and open the body, preparing the mind for deeper states of concentration.
#### Four Objects of Attention
The practice involves holding up to four objects of attention simultaneously: the breath, whole energy body space, visual imagination of numbers, and aural sense of counting. This multi-object focus is designed to engage the mind more fully, providing clearer "pegs" for attention and preventing it from getting lost. Participants can emphasize different objects while maintaining whole-body awareness.
#### Adjusting Breath Length
The guided meditation progresses through different breath lengths, starting with a count of nine, then reducing to six, and finally to three. This adjustment allows practitioners to experience the practice with varying degrees of breath intensity and observe how focus and energy levels shift with shorter breaths. The pace of counting remains consistent across breath lengths.
#### Identifying Spacing Out
Participants are encouraged to notice when they tend to lose focus or space out during the breath cycle. By identifying these moments of decreased presence, they can apply more intention and effort to be fully present, especially at those points in the cycle where attention tends to wane. This self-awareness is crucial for deepening concentration.
#### Energizing Effect of Long Breath
The lecture explains that the long breath technique is offered because many individuals, especially at the beginning of retreats, experience low energy despite potential mental agitation. The long breath is highlighted as a powerful tool for energizing the body and mind, counteracting low energy and promoting alertness.
#### Practice Power and Jhāna
The speaker emphasizes the potential power of this counting within the breath practice, suggesting that even the initial stage with a count of nine could lead one to the edge of the first Jhāna. This highlights the depth and effectiveness of the technique if practiced diligently, encouraging participants not to underestimate its potential.
#### Advantage of Counting Within Breath
Counting within the breath is advantageous because it provides more "pegs" for attention compared to simply focusing on the breath itself. These additional pegs, such as the numbers, engage the mind more actively, making it easier to maintain focus and allowing consciousness to coalesce in an energized manner.
#### Posture and Comfort for Jhāna
Comfortable posture is deemed essential for Jhāna practice. Personal experience is shared about how posture adjustments significantly improved samādhi. Participants are encouraged to seek advice on posture and consider alternating postures to avoid body stress during prolonged sitting.
#### Working with Pain Later
While pain can be incorporated into Jhāna practice, it is advised to address comfort first. The lecture suggests establishing a comfortable and stable practice before introducing the element of relating to pain within Jhāna. Working with pain is presented as a later stage in the practice.
#### Importance of Movement
Incorporating movement practices like yoga or qigong is recommended to complement sitting meditation. Movement helps circulate energy and care for the body, especially during retreats involving extensive sitting, walking, and standing. A moderate amount of daily movement is suggested to support overall well-being.
#### Mindful Walks
Taking walks outside the retreat grounds with the intention of enjoyment, heart-opening, and sensory appreciation is encouraged. These mindful walks are meant to foster appreciation for beauty and open the senses, providing a balance to the more formal meditation practices.
#### Running and Energy
The impact of vigorous exercise like running is discussed as individual and context-dependent. Running can be beneficial for circulating stagnant energy at times, but at other times, it might disturb the energy. Responsiveness and self-awareness are key to determining if running is supportive or disruptive to practice.
#### Interviews Focus on Jhāna Practice
Interviews during this retreat are specifically focused on Jhāna practice. While teachers are generally interested in participants' lives, the interviews are intentionally contained to address what is happening in their meditation practice, thinking about practice, and related experiences on the cushion and during walking meditation.
#### Putting Aside Unfinished Business
Participants are strongly encouraged to complete any unfinished business, such as calls or emails, as early as possible in the retreat. This is emphasized as a significant gift to oneself, enabling deeper relaxation, openness, and enjoyment of the retreat experience by minimizing distractions.
#### Retreat Helpers Introduction
Three helpers, Laurence, Lea, and Nic, are introduced to the retreat participants. Their role is to assist the teacher, and it is mentioned that they may need to move around and prioritize tasks, requiring understanding and accommodation from the group.
#### Slowing Down Movement
Slowing down movements is advised, but not to the extreme of very slow Mahāsi style. The recommended pace is slow enough to maintain whole-body awareness while moving around. This pace supports cultivating energetic awareness and a sense of embodied presence.
#### Whole Body Awareness in Movement
Moving slowly facilitates maintaining whole-body awareness even during activities like walking. This continuous whole-body awareness, whether in the foreground or background of attention, is considered a crucial aspect of the practice, especially in the context of Jhāna development, where it becomes central.
