### Details
#### Retreat Schedule and Teachings
The retreat's initial days are described as dense with teachings, becoming sparser later. The speaker acknowledges the volume of information but assures attendees that the evening tea wash-up schedule is flexible. The analogy of reaching Newton Abbot from different directions is introduced to illustrate varied paths to meditation.

#### Analogy of Newton Abbot
The speaker uses the analogy of different routes to Newton Abbot to convey that various meditation techniques can lead to the same goal, samādhi.  Just as different paths can reach the same destination, different meditation practices, even seemingly opposite ones, can be equally viable and effective. This encourages openness to different techniques.

#### Breath Focus Techniques
The session contrasts the previously introduced whole-body awareness with more traditional breath-focused techniques.  Classical methods like focusing on the upper lip, nose, or abdomen are mentioned as alternatives to be explored in coming days. This variety is presented as a "buffet" or "smorgasbord" of options to suit individual preferences and experiences.

#### Energy Body for Samādhi
The concept of the energy body is introduced as relevant to samādhi practice.  It's described as a broad and evolving concept, but the current focus is on understanding and utilizing the energy body specifically to enhance samādhi. The talk aims to provide an introductory understanding rather than an exhaustive explanation.

#### Definition of Whole Body
'Whole body' is defined for the retreat context as the felt sense of a space slightly larger than the physical body.  This definition emphasizes the subjective, felt experience of this expanded space, rather than strict physical boundaries.  Attention and awareness directed to the 'whole body' refer to this felt sense of the extended space.

#### Definition of Energy Body
'Energy body' is described as the vibration, feeling, texture, or energy within the 'whole body' space. It's differentiated from typical physical sensations, being more subtle and related to a deeper stratum of experience.  Terms like texture, vibration, and feeling are used to point towards this less tangible aspect of bodily awareness.

#### Energy Body Integration and Homogeneity
Two key aspects of the energy body for samādhi are integration and homogeneity. Integration refers to the sense of the body as one unified experience, rather than a collection of separate parts. Homogeneity describes both the experience and awareness becoming uniform throughout the whole space, without a sense of localized attention.

#### Coaxing the Energy Body for Samādhi
The lecture distinguishes between observing the energy body and actively coaxing it towards pleasant states for samādhi.  While acceptance and openness are valid approaches, samādhi practice involves a directed effort to encourage the energy body into desirable conditions. This implies a more active and intentional engagement with the energy body.

#### Temperature Sensitivity and Energy Body
Personal observations about temperature sensitivity affecting the energy body are shared.  It's suggested that subtle changes in body temperature, like removing a shawl, can significantly impact the energy body experience in samādhi practice. Experimentation with clothing and warmth levels is encouraged to find what best supports the energy body.

#### Guided Meditation - Posture
The guided meditation begins with emphasizing the importance of posture.  Attendees are urged to actively find a balanced posture that embodies both uprightness and openness.  This balanced posture is described as having a tangible feeling and influencing the mind, promoting dignity, nobility, receptivity, and alertness.

#### Guided Meditation - Whole Body Awareness
The meditation guides participants to open awareness to the whole body, meaning the felt sense of the space slightly larger than the physical form.  The instruction is to inhabit this space with bright, alive sensitivity, focusing on the texture and vibration of this expanded space rather than reinforcing the physical body image.

#### Guided Meditation - Breath and Whole Space
Participants are guided to notice the breath within the context of whole-body awareness.  The focus is on observing how the breath affects and changes the felt sense of the whole space, including sensations of expansion and contraction throughout the body with each inhalation and exhalation.

#### Guided Meditation - Longest Comfortable Breath
The meditation introduces the practice of establishing the "longest comfortable breath."  This involves breathing slower and longer than usual without strain, emphasizing smoothness and comfort.  The breath is described as relatively subtle, not requiring a large volume of air, and is integrated with whole-body awareness.

#### Guided Meditation - Expansion and Contraction
During the meditation, attention is directed to the sensations of expansion and contraction of the whole body space with each breath.  Participants are asked to feel how the entire space, including areas beyond the typical breathing focus, expands on inhalation and contracts on exhalation, tuning into these subtle movements.

#### Guided Meditation - Energization and Relaxation
The meditation further guides awareness to the energizing quality of the in-breath and the relaxing quality of the out-breath within the whole body space.  Participants are encouraged to sense and enjoy these qualities, noticing how the breath naturally energizes and relaxes the entire felt space.

#### Guided Meditation - Breath at Solar Plexus
A technique of imagining the breath entering at the solar plexus is introduced.  Participants are asked to visualize or kinesthetically imagine the breath originating from this point and observe how it affects the whole body.  The possibility of sensing energy currents emanating from the solar plexus, moving up and down the body, is also explored.

#### Guided Meditation - Experimenting with Breath
The final part of the guided meditation encourages experimentation with different breath lengths and types. Participants are prompted to explore what kind of breath feels best and most pleasant in the whole body space, moving beyond default breathing patterns to find a breath that truly enhances the meditative experience.

#### Recap of Guided Meditation
The recap summarizes the key elements of the guided meditation: posture, longest breath, expansion/contraction of whole space, energization/relaxation, and potential energy currents.  These are presented as components to experiment with and incorporate as desired, emphasizing individual exploration and adaptation.

#### Subtlety and Refinement in Samādhi
The lecture emphasizes that samādhi is more about increasing subtlety and refinement than intense focus.  Coarse breathing techniques, like ujjayi breath, are discouraged as they hinder the necessary refinement for deeper samādhi. The journey into jhāna is described as a path of increasing subtlety in both breath and mind.

#### Sensitivity, Responsivity, and Willingness
Three key principles for samādhi practice are highlighted: sensitivity, responsivity, and willingness to experiment.  These principles apply initially to breath length and type, but extend to all aspects of deepening samādhi.  Cultivating these qualities is presented as the opposite of inertia and essential for progress.

#### Whole-body Awareness in Daily Life
The importance of maintaining a relaxed, general whole-body awareness in daily life, between formal meditation sessions, is discussed.  This easeful awareness, without intense focus, is seen as crucial for allowing the meditative process to unfold and for cultivating a continuous state of open and relaxed presence.

#### Cultivating Appreciation
In addition to whole-body awareness, cultivating appreciation throughout the day is emphasized.  This involves nurturing a positive and appreciative mindset, supporting overall well-being and a deeper sense of nourishment for the mind and heart, complementing the formal meditation practice.
